Bash-Scripts
============

Scripts written to help your Linux/Bash shell environment.

"clean.sh" removes any old dependencies then removes all packages that have been downloaded and installed as you /most likely/ will not have to install them again.

"update.sh" checks for updates for packages from repositories. Then updates what you already have before performing the bigger distro upgrades.
